_Song Specialties for Your Entertainments_


Teachers are discovering that no matter how much novelty there is in
their entertainment, how well it is arranged, how thoroughly drilled,
if they want to hold the active interest of the audience they must use
the best of songs. The songs must be real novelties. The words must be
interesting as well as decidedly clever. The music must be catchy and
abounding in rich melody. With these things in mind we have prepared
this list of superior song novelties for our patrons. All are in
regular sheet music form.

CLOSING SONGS

A Party in Mother Goose Land


SIX little girls in white come before curtain and sing:

_Air:_ AULD LANG SYNE.

 1—O, COME with us awhile away
      Sail over Memory’s sea.
    Come to the Land of Story Books
      Where old friends wait for thee.

_Chorus:_

    The Land of dear old Story Books,
      Of dear old Story Books
    Come view with us awhile, we pray,
      The Land of Story Books.

 2—You’ll meet again those friends who passed
      Such happy hours away,
    And brightened all your childhood years
      With tales so glad and gay.

Girls leave stage and curtain rises showing a room in the house
of MOTHER GOOSE, who is seated in a large chair at side of stage,
near front. Chairs for guests are in back of room. Guests enter
opposite side of room from MOTHER GOOSE. As curtain rises BOY
BLUE enters and says:

BOY BLUE:

DEAR Mother Goose, Jack Horner said
  That you had need of me,
So here I am at your command,
Whate’er the task may be.

MOTHER GOOSE:

Tonight, Boy Blue, my dear old friends
  Who live afar, anear,
In this fair Land of Story Books
  Will come to greet me here.
My footmen, who have served me well,
  Have all, both young and old,
Gone searching for the rainbow’s end
  To find the pot of gold.
And you, tonight, I pray, Boy Blue,
  Stand close beside me here
Announcing every guest who comes
  In voice so loud and clear
That I shall understand each name,
  And no mistakes occur.
I called the Cheshire Cat “King Cole”
  Until I heard him purr
Last time they came. My eyesight’s poor,
  And footmen speak so low
I’m never sure just what they say,
  So how am I to know?

BOY BLUE:

Leave that to me, dear Mother Goose.
  I’ll make you understand.
I’m confident that I shall be
  A footman, proud and grand.
My horn shall be a megaphone
  And guests, not sheep, I’ll call.
They’ll soon be coming. Let us hope
  That I shall know them all.

[_To audience_]:

I’m Mother Goose’s footman now.
  I’m sure I’ll please her well.
I’ll plainly speak and stiffly bow
  As names of guests I tell.

MOTHER GOOSE:

Be ready, for they’re coming now.
  I hope my cap’s on straight.
Go promptly when they knock, Boy Blue,
  And do not make them wait.

A knock is heard. BOY BLUE opens door, announces thru horn
“HANSEL AND GRETEL”. They enter, advancing to front. Same form
is used for entrance of all the guests who seat themselves at back
of stage after speaking or singing.

HANSEL:

We’re happy as the day is long
  Our hearts are full of joy
Since we destroyed the wicked witch
  Who can no more annoy.
The children, turned to gingerbread
  By reason of her wiles,
Are now themselves again, and free—
  Their faces wreathed in smiles.

GRETEL:

Our father now is very rich.
  Whene’er we go afar
Into the forest after flowers
  We take our motor car.

MOTHER GOOSE: You deserve good fortune, children.

BOY BLUE: Robinson Crusoe.

ROBINSON CRUSOE:

It’s good to be at home once more
Far from the billow’s angry roar.
No desert island life for me.
I never more shall go to sea.
No more in distant climes I’ll roam
But live with Friday, safe at home.
Yes, I’m Robinson Crusoe, a man of great genius, ’tis true.
I was shipwrecked once upon the waters blue.
Life is lonely, out on a desert isle,
So I’ll stay at home for the rest of my life—
At least, I’ll stay awhile.

MOTHER GOOSE: I’m sure I hope you will stay at home,
Robinson.

BOY BLUE: Jack the Giant Killer.

JACK THE GIANT KILLER:

My call tonight must needs be brief.
  A task before me lies.
A giant’s captured yonder town
  But ere the dawn he dies.
My trusty sword shall lay him low.
  No giants need apply
To rule the Land of Story Books
  While I am waiting nigh.

MOTHER GOOSE:

Brave Jack the Giant Killer
  Our people never fear.
They know that you’ll protect us.
  No danger can come near.

BOY BLUE: Puss in Boots.

[PUSS _sings_]:

_Air:_ COMIN’ THRU THE RYE.

1—

I’m a very wise young Pussy—
  Wondrous tricks I do.
Made my master rich and titled—
  Taught him how to woo.

_Chorus:_

Puss in Boots is what they call me,
  Very sly, they say.
If e’er you need my wise assistance
  Call on me I pray.

2—

Craftiness becomes a virtue
  As employed by me.
Brains must win in any contest
  Gain the victory.

MOTHER GOOSE: Sly Boots, you are a useful friend at
times.

BOY BLUE: Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

GOLDILOCKS:

Three bears, one summer, long ago
  Most frightened me to death.
I left their house and ran and ran
  Till I quite lost my breath.
They found me sleeping peacefully
  Within their little bed,
But when they growled I quickly woke
  And thru the window fled.
Then, when I realized my fault,
  I went to make amends.
I found them very charming bears
  And now we’re splendid friends.
Aren’t we, bears?

BEARS: You bet we are.

[_They sing_]:

_Air:_ UPIDEE.

SONG

Miss Goldilocks may use our chairs,
If she cares, if she cares.
Or eat the porridge in our bowls
And our milk and rolls.
Yes, all we have to her we’d lend
For she is now our dearest friend.

_Chorus:_

Goldilocks is now our friend,
Dearest friend, dearest friend.
Goldilocks is now our friend,
Very dearest friend.

[_Growl one and one half measures_]: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

[_Repeat first four lines of chorus._]

MOTHER GOOSE:

Dear child, I’m glad you bro’t your bears
  To visit me tonight.
Tho’ had I met them all alone
  I might have had a fright.

BOY BLUE: Aladdin.

ALADDIN:

I bro’t my lamps along tonight.
  I tho’t you’d like to see
What wondrous things it can produce
  When helped along by me.

[_He rubs lamp_]: FAIRY _enters_.

FAIRY:

You called and I came at your bidding
  I hastened from far away.
The Lamp of Aladdin has spoken
  The call I must ever obey
O’er torrents and seas wild and raging
  At your behest I fly.
Your slightest wish ever commands me
  The Slave of the Lamp am I.

ALADDIN:

I pray you bring me quickly
  Red roses, fresh and sweet.
I wish to lay an offering
  At Mother Goose’s feet.

FAIRY leaves while soft music is played and returns at once,
bearing roses, which she gives to ALADDIN. It is very effective if
at FAIRY’S entrances and exits the stage may be darkened for a
moment, switching lights off and on, and the sound of thunder
heard.

FAIRY:

I bring you sweet red roses
  All wet with fairy dew.
They grew in Fancy’s garden
  Where skies are ever blue.
You called and I came at your bidding.
  No wish will I deny
If the Lamp of Aladdin has spoken.
  The Slave of the Lamp am I. [_Exits_.]

MOTHER: Thank you, Aladdin, for the flowers.

BOY BLUE: Red Riding Hood and the Woodcutters.

RED RIDING HOOD:

Whenever I go out to play I take along with me
These brave Woodcutters to protect me from calamity.
They saved me once, as well you know, when I had disobeyed
And lingered in the forest to play within the shade.
The Wolf would soon have eaten me had they not heard my cries
And rushed to kill the cruel beast before my frightened eyes.
Since then I never venture far from my beloved home,
But take the Woodcutters with me, if I’m inclined to roam.

[WOODCUTTERS _sing_]:

_Air:_ MINSTREL BOY.

SONG

We fell the trees with mighty strokes.
  All day long our chips are flying.
The ash, the elm, the sturdy oak,
  In our path you’ll find them lying.
Our ax blades are so clean and bright,
  They flash as high we swing them.
We use them well from dawn till night,
  Then to our shoulders bring them.

MOTHER GOOSE: Red Riding Hood is fortunate to have
you to protect her.

BOY BLUE: The Owl and the Pussy Cat.

OWL _and_ PUSSY CAT _together:_

Oh, don’t you remember the wise little Owl
  With feathers bewitchingly brown,
And the gray Pussy Cat with the sweet, tender smile,
  Who never was known to frown?
By the light of the moon, on the edge of the sand,
  By the Turkey that lives on the hill,
We were married one day as we stood hand in hand
  And we danced by the rippling rill.
      And we’ve lived happily ever after.

MOTHER GOOSE: I’m glad to hear that.

BOY BLUE: Bluebeard and his Wives.

BLUEBEARD:

I have been most basely slandered
  All the world thinks ill of me;
Says my pretty wives I murdered,
  Locked the door and hid the key.
With my kindly disposition
  Could I treat a lady so?
Here they are, alive and happy,
  As they’ve always been, you know.

WIVES:

We went away, one summer day
  To do all our spring shopping
Forgot to tell dear Bluebeard where
  Or how long we’d be stopping.
Then Sister Anne got in a fright,
  Unlocked the door forbidden—
She saw red paint all splashed around
  And tho’t us slain and hidden.

BLUEBEARD: So, you see, I’ve been slandered.

MOTHER GOOSE: Yes, indeed, Bluebeard. You’re a good,
kind man as everyone should know.

BOY BLUE: Cinderella and the Prince.

CINDERELLA:

Although I am a Princess now, I never shall forget
  The rags I wore as scullery maid. In fact, I keep them yet.
Whene’er I think I’m growing proud I look at them to see
  What homely tasks I once performed, and learn humility.

PRINCE:

    Among my choicest treasures a slipper small you’ll see
    ’Twas lost by someone at a ball and then returned to me.

MOTHER GOOSE: And it bro’t you a wonderful Princess, did it not?

BOY BLUE: Peter from Holland.

PETER:

    I found a leak within the dike
      And stopped it with my strong right arm,
    But any boy would do as much
      To save his native land from harm.

MOTHER GOOSE: You were a brave boy, Peter.

BOY BLUE: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

SNOW WHITE:

    My trusty friends, the Seven Dwarfs, I introduce to you.
    I lived with them for many years, and found them good and true.

[DWARFS _sing_]:

_Air:_ COME BACK TO ERIN.

SONG.

    Come back to us, little Snow White, we miss you.
      Long are the hours since you first went away.
    Come back to us with the flowers of the springtime.
      Then once again we’ll be happy and gay.
    When, by the embers, we sit in the gloaming,
      Watching the hearth fire you tended so well,
    Sad are our tho’ts for each moment we miss you,
      Miss you far more than our cold words can tell.
    Then come back to us, little Snow White, we miss you.
      Long are the hours since you first went away.
    Come back to us with the flowers of the springtime,
      Then once again we’ll be happy and gay.

SNOW WHITE:

    Dear Dwarfs, how very kind of you to think so much of me.
    I’ll visit you when springtime comes, and we shall happy be.

BOY BLUE: Dick Whittington and his Cat.

DICK:

    This little Cat is my best friend, she made my fortune once,
    And if I should forget her now I’d be a perfect dunce.
    She bro’t me gold. She heard the bells that said, “Lord Mayor, turn.”
    And now she has the very best it’s in my power to earn.

MOTHER GOOSE: You are a wise man, Lord Mayor of London.

BOY BLUE: Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

[ROBIN _and his men sing_]:

_Air:_ LOCH LOMOND.

    We roam, free from care, o’er the world everywhere.
      In the forest watch we are keeping.
    Many brave wrongs we right,
    Beneath the pale moonlight,
      While the silent world around us is sleeping.

CHORUS:

    Our roof is the sky and our home the good greenwood,
      We wander from dawn until gloaming,
    For bold Robin Hood and his Merry, Merry Men
      Must be ever thru the dark forest roaming.

MOTHER GOOSE: Many a good deed is done by you and your merry men I am
sure, Robin.

BOY BLUE: Hiawatha and his Braves.

[BRAVES _sing_]:

_Air:_ THE MOCKING BIRD.

SONG.

[HIAWATHA _stands with folded arms_.]

    We left our wigwams lonely, in the valley, in the valley.
      We left our wigwams lonely, shining white as lilies ’neath the
            stars cold gleam.
    We came with Hiawatha, Hiawatha, Hiawatha,
      We came with Hiawatha—in our birch canoes we drifted down the
            stream.

_Chorus:_

    Hiawatha’s braves are we, Hiawatha’s braves are we,
      Our tents like lilies in the valley glow.
    Hiawatha’s braves are we, Hiawatha’s braves are we,
      We’ll follow him wherever he may go.

MOTHER GOOSE [_to_ BOY BLUE]: I’m glad they left their tomahawks at
home. You are welcome Braves. Hiawatha, I am glad to see you.

BOY BLUE: Captain Kidd and his Pirates.

KIDD:

I’m Captain Kidd and these my Pirates bold.

PIRATES:

And a Captain fine is he.

KIDD:

We have sailed the seas and captured tons of gold.

PIRATES:

We’re as rich as rich can be.

KIDD and PIRATES [_together_]:

        Oh, we’re Pirates, bad and bold,
        And we rove the seas for gold.
    We scuttle ships and make captives walk the plank,
    And we laugh with horrid glee as we push them in the sea
        And they drown in the water so cold.

MOTHER GOOSE [_aside_]: I hope he isn’t telling the truth, but he
always was the black sheep of the family.

    I think you’re joking, Captain Kidd,
      And want to frighten me.
    I’m sure you never scuttled ships
      And caused such misery.

[KIDD _and_ PIRATES _laugh wickedly as they go to their seats_.]

BOY BLUE: Alice from Wonderland, the White Rabbit, the King and Queen
of Hearts, the King and Queen of Diamonds, the King and Queen of Clubs,
the King and Queen of Spades.

ALICE:

    Some friends from Wonderland are here
      These Kings and Queens, who came
    Because they like to be a part
      Of every little game.
    The Cheshire Cat, I grieve to say,
      Is seriously ill.
    He choked upon his smile today,
      The Doctor’s with him still.
    The Doormouse is, of course, asleep;
      The Lizard’s out to tea.
    The Hatter’s madder than of old
      And wouldn’t come with me.
    White Rabbit, say your little speech
      To Mother Goose, I pray.

WHITE RABBIT:

    It gives me pleasure, Alice,
      To do whate’er you say.
    There’s a curious land where the footmen are frogs,
      And the Jubberwock prowls all the day;
    Where we paint the white roses a beautiful red
      And the Mock Turtle weeps at his play.
    Where the babies can turn into wonderful pigs,
      And you balance an eel on your nose.
    ’Tis the Wonderland Alice discovered one day.
      Its location we’ll never disclose.

[_If possible have_ KINGS _and_ QUEENS _dance a minuet to music of_ DON
JUAN.]

MOTHER GOOSE: I’ve been so glad to see you all.

    Before you go we’ll sing one song and part with right good cheer.
    I hope we all shall meet again before another year.

    [_All stand and sing_.]

[_All stand and sing_]:

_Air:_ WHEN THE SWALLOWS HOMEWARD FLY.

SONG.

    In the Land of Story Books,
    Where are quaint, familiar nooks,
    Old friends greet us every day—
    Cheering words to us they say.
    All our woes end happily,
    Troubles never last you see
    In the Land of Story Books,
    Pleasant Land of Story Books,
    In the Land of Story Books.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
